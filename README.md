# Reconstruction

This repository serves as my coding practice journal as I rebuild my coding skills after spending 8 years in engineering management. It's a personal journey of reconstruction - getting back to coding agility and hands-on technical proficiency.

## Purpose

After dedicating 8 years to engineering management, I'm working to reconstruct my coding abilities through deliberate practice. This repository contains various coding exercises, challenges, and practice problems that I'm working through to sharpen my skills.

## Structure

Each file in this repository represents a different coding challenge or exercise. The solutions are implemented in JavaScript/Node.js, and the exercises range from fundamental programming concepts to more complex algorithms and data structures.

## Goals

- Rebuild muscle memory for coding
- Practice modern JavaScript/Node.js patterns and practices
- Document my journey from engineering management back to hands-on technical work
- Create a reference for others who might be on a similar path

## Running the Examples

Most examples can be run using Node.js. For instance:

```bash
node src/[filename].js [arguments]
```
